## Development

To set up for development, just run `npm run dev`. This will reload both the client and the server whenever a relevant file is edited and saved. Navigate to `localhost:4321` in two different tabs, and you will hopefully have set up a P2P connection to yourself. If you're successful, you should see a video stream from yourself. **Beware of audio feedback loops!**
